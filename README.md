# Raylib Random Physics 
 
## A Simple C physics projects

I am aimming to create a small project simualting physics.

I will be using:
- C for programming.
- Raylib for randering.
- Bash for automating the construction and compilation of the project.

The final scope of the project is to keep practicing my C and learn more about programming physics and renderaing.

## Objectives:
- [ ] Create an enviorment
- [ ] Create particles with different colors
- [ ] Implement physiscs like (Graviti, Friction, Velocity, Bouncing)
- [ ] Implement enviorment colisions (Particles interact with enviorment)
- [ ] Implement particles colisions (Particles interact with other particles)
- [ ] Implement a system where 2 particles colide with each other it will spawn two more particles.
- [ ] Create a Ui where it shows the number of particles the fps and other important stuff.
- [ ] Optimise the system.
